        <h3><p>Ok, so this is where I'm going to put my new deck list. I'm also going to be practicing my html skills through this as well.</p></h3>

        <h3><p>A little background on why I'm building this deck. So one of my TCG friend built a new deck, which is a Dragapult ex deck. He is
            already skilled with his previous dangerous deck which is Gardevoir ex. Then there is also my other TCG friend that is going
            to build a new "strong" deck. Based on his tone, I bet its pretty legit.
        </p></h3>

        <h3><P>After all of that being said, here is my list :)</P></h3>
